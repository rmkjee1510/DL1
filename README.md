Breast Cancer Classifier
The Project employs cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques to enhance early breast cancer detection. Leveraging the power of neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the project aims to analyze medical images, such as mammograms and biopsies, to identify potential indicators of malignancy. By training the neural network on a comprehensive dataset of labeled breast images, the system learns to recognize patterns, textures, and features associated with both benign and malignant tumors.
